# Cursor Live Smoke Checklist

> **Cost-conscious verification:** Offline/faux checks first; reuse exact-input retained evidence. Use only the smallest meaningful changed-behavior live check on one representative environment when real-service proof is necessary. Docs/metadata-only changes need no paid runs. The full `smoke:platform:all` matrix is optional. No paid Cloud testing for generic PRs/releases; only explicitly Cursor Cloud-focused PRs/issues may select necessary focused Cloud proof. Automated Cursor PR reviews continue unchanged. See [docs/platform-smoke.md](./platform-smoke.md).

## Purpose

Use this checklist as a menu, not a mandatory campaign. Select only behavior that changed and needs new real-service evidence after offline/faux checks and retained-proof reuse. Do not run host matrices merely for matrix coverage or automatically retry paid failures. See [Cursor testing lessons](./cursor-testing-lessons.md) for isolated-harness and replay pitfalls. Selected checks keep their distinct assertions, persisted evidence, visual proof, and cleanup requirements; do not claim unobserved coverage.

## Inner-loop rule

- Build first: `npm run build` after any `src/` edit — the pi manifest loads compiled `dist/`, so unbuilt runs validate stale code. (the cloud/steering/local-resume/provider-debug launchers rebuild automatically even when run directly with `node scripts/...`; `smoke:live`/`smoke:visual`/`smoke:isolated` build via their npm scripts; direct `pi -e .` invocations do not build.)
- Run from a clean working tree except for the intended branch diff.
- Use the local extension under test: `pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6`.
- Use a temporary `--session-dir` for every run.
- Do not paste or commit Cursor API keys, raw session contents with secrets, endpoint URLs, or local private paths.
- If a selected check fails, retain evidence and diagnose offline before choosing a repair or a necessary follow-up call. No automatic paid retries.
- Scope new live calls to changed behavior that needs real-service proof; retain valid proof for unchanged behavior. Do not run every checklist section or the full matrix as a routine commit/release step.
- A check is passed only when the visible TUI/output, stderr diagnostics, and persisted JSONL agree with the expected behavior.

## Prerequisites

```bash
export SMOKE_DIR="/tmp/pi-cursor-sdk-live-smoke-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$SMOKE_DIR"
node --version
pi --version
npm ls @cursor/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/server @modelcontextprotocol/hono hono @hono/node-server @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent @earendil-works/pi-ai @earendil-works/pi-tui
pi --approve -e . --list-models cursor
```

Live pi runs resolve provider auth from **`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`**, not only shell env. Isolated smoke copies that file into a clean temporary `HOME`. Ensure `auth.json` includes a `cursor` provider entry, or export `CURSOR_API_KEY` as a fallback.

The repo also ships partial automation for the prerequisite/basic/default-settings/non-interactive math/TUI output polling/steering/diagnostic/JSONL subset:

```bash
npm run smoke:live
```

`npm run smoke:live` resolves `pi`, `node`, `npm`, `rg`, and `tmux` once in the parent shell, then runs all `pi` shims with the resolved Node directory first on `PATH`. It clears inherited Cursor SDK event-debug env for every child pi run. Isolated helper cases force `PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none`; the `default-settings` helper case explicitly unsets `PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES` so it exercises the default ambient setting-source path.

The canonical visual runner for section 4 is checked in separately. POSIX artifact output requires `cc` for its descriptor-relative helper; Windows artifact mutations fail closed because Node has no equivalent handle-relative API:

```bash
npm run smoke:visual -- --help
```

For native replay regression checks (packed install, plan-strip resync, JSONL replay-error scan), use the isolated helper:

```bash
npm run smoke:isolated
# unit tests + pack only (no live Cursor):
SKIP_LIVE=1 npm run smoke:isolated
# sealed PATH/debug-env guard for the isolated helper:
npm run smoke:isolated -- --self-test
```

`npm run smoke:isolated` follows the same smoke-runner env contract as live/visual/steering helpers: pack-only work resolves only `node`, `npm`, and `env` from the parent shell and does not require `pi`; live checks then resolve `pi` and `rg`. It runs pi/npm shims with the resolved Node directory first on `PATH`, clears Cursor SDK event-debug env, forces `PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none` for provider checks, and explicitly unsets `PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES` for install/list checks.

Scan persisted sessions for native replay tool failures:

```bash
node scripts/validate-smoke-jsonl.mjs --replay-errors "$SMOKE_DIR"
node scripts/validate-smoke-jsonl.mjs --replay-errors-only "$SMOKE_DIR/session-subdir"
```

The replay scan flags only error `toolResult` / error assistant messages with `Tool grep/cursor/find/ls not found`, not successful reads of docs that mention those strings. See [Cursor testing lessons](./cursor-testing-lessons.md#what-counts-as-a-replay-failure).

`npm run smoke:live` is a helper only; it polls the section 3 TUI for answer/footer evidence and then cleans up the tmux session, but it does not replace the canonical rendered-PNG visual review in section 4. Run the relevant helper `--self-test` (`smoke:live`, `smoke:visual`, `smoke:steering`, or `smoke:isolated`) when changing sealed PATH or env wrappers. For changed behavior needing new live evidence, select the relevant manual check or existing single-suite/single-target platform run, not both by default. The comprehensive matrix is optional.

Pass criteria:

- `node --version` reports Node 24+.
- `pi --version` reports official Pi 0.87.1 or the selected official-latest/current-`fitchmultz/pi` compatibility target.
- `npm ls` shows exact `@cursor/sdk@1.0.35`; development `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, and `@earendil-works/pi-tui` 1.0.3 with matching lockfile-resolved transitives, nested host TypeBox 1.3.27 and root validation TypeBox 1.3.35; and the bundled bridge runtime closure `@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.3.1`, `@modelcontextprotocol/hono@2.0.2`, `hono@4.13.13`, and `@hono/node-server@2.1.3`.
- `cursor/grok-4.6` appears in the model list.
- No Cursor key or auth token is printed.
- If neither `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` cursor auth nor `CURSOR_API_KEY` is available, stop and report the live smoke as blocked.

## 1. Basic provider reality check

```bash
PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none \
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/basic" \
  --no-tools \
  -p 'Live smoke. Reply exactly: PI_CURSOR_SMOKE_OK' \
  > "$SMOKE_DIR/basic.stdout.txt" \
  2> "$SMOKE_DIR/basic.stderr.txt"
```

Pass criteria:

- Exit code is `0`.
- stdout contains `PI_CURSOR_SMOKE_OK`.
- stderr is empty or contains only expected non-secret diagnostics for the specific test.
- The persisted JSONL has exactly one assistant message with non-negative usage fields. For a safe local `turn-ended` sample, `input + cacheRead + cacheWrite` equals the full prompt and those components plus `output` equal `totalTokens`; unsafe local data and Cloud turns use bounded estimates. Billed `Agent.getUsage()` observations belong to the durable usage ledger, not assistant-message occupancy.

## 2. Default setting-source startup noise check

```bash
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/default-settings" \
  --no-tools \
  -p 'Default settings smoke. Include PRODUCT=42 in the final answer.' \
  > "$SMOKE_DIR/default-settings.stdout.txt" \
  2> "$SMOKE_DIR/default-settings.stderr.txt"
```

Pass criteria:

- Exit code is `0`.
- stdout includes `PRODUCT=42`.
- stderr is empty.
- No Cursor SDK settings/skills startup logs corrupt stdout or the TUI.

## 3. TUI observation check

Run a real interactive session under tmux:

```bash
SESSION="pi-cursor-sdk-smoke-$(date +%s)"
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -x 120 -y 40 -- zsh -lc \
  "cd '$PWD' && PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 --session-dir '$SMOKE_DIR/tui' --session-id cursor-sdk-1016-tui --no-tools 'TUI smoke. Compute 19 + 23. Reply only with SUM=<number>.'"
```

Observe with `tmux capture-pane -pt "$SESSION"` or attach manually.

Pass criteria:

- Footer shows the selected `cursor/grok-4.6` model (typically rendered as `(cursor) grok-4.6`). With `--cursor-no-fast`, Cursor fast mode is off and the Cursor extension status should show `cursor:local · fast:off`; ignore unrelated status text from other extensions.
- The run uses Pi 0.84.0 `--session-id` successfully.
- Footer shows `(cursor) composer-2-5`. With `--cursor-no-fast`, Cursor fast mode is off and the Cursor extension status should show `cursor:local · fast:off`; ignore unrelated status text from other extensions.
- The run uses supported Pi `--session-id` successfully.
- Assistant answer appears correctly.
- `/session` shows one user and one assistant message for the simple run.
- Persisted JSONL has one assistant message. If the screen appears duplicated, inspect JSONL before deciding whether it is a rendering bug.
- Kill the tmux session after the check and verify no smoke tmux sessions remain.

## 4. Focused visual card/color rendering check

This is a visual debug menu for changed card/color behavior requiring new live evidence. Select only the relevant category below, or reuse a batched existing platform suite; do not execute the entire list by default. It requires offscreen TUI visual inspection, not only JSONL or code review. Use Node 24+, official Pi 0.87.1 or another current compatibility target, exact `@cursor/sdk@1.0.35`, a fresh temporary session dir, Cursor SDK `plan` mode, native replay enabled, and the checked-in visual runner. The runner resolves `pi` by directly walking the parent `PATH`, uses `process.execPath` for Node, and prepends that Node directory for both prereq checks and tmux launches so `#!/usr/bin/env node` shims use the validated Node. The default matrix is native replay only: native replay registration is forced on, settings sources are `none`, the pi bridge is off, overlapping built-in pi tools are not exposed, and inherited Cursor SDK event-debug artifact env is cleared. With `--event-debug`, debug capture writes to a deterministic directory under `VISUAL_DIR`.

```bash
VISUAL_DIR="$(mktemp -d /tmp/pi-cursor-sdk-1016-visual.XXXXXX)"
VISUAL_ARGS=(
  --ext "$PWD"
  --cwd "$PWD"
  --out-dir "$VISUAL_DIR"
  --wait-ms 60000
  --event-debug
)

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label read-package \
  --prompt 'Use only your file read tool. Read ./package.json and answer with only the package name. Do not use shell, grep, glob, find, or list tools.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label grep-readme \
  --prompt 'Use only your grep/search tool to search ./README.md for the literal string "pi-cursor-sdk". Do not use shell, read, glob, find, ls, or list tools. Report only the first matching file path.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label find-readme \
  --prompt 'Use only your glob/file-search/find tool to find README.md from the repository root. Do not use shell, read, grep, ls, or list tools. Report matched paths exactly.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label list-src \
  --prompt 'Use only your directory listing tool to list ./src. Do not use shell, read, grep, glob, or find tools. Report whether cursor-provider.ts is present.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label shell-success \
  --prompt "Use only your shell/terminal tool to run printf 'cursor visual smoke\\n'. Do not use read, grep, glob, find, ls, edit, or write. Report the output."

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label write-file \
  --prompt 'Use your normal file write tool to create .debug/visual-smoke/cursor-mode.txt with exactly two lines: alpha and beta. Do not use shell.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label edit-file \
  --prompt 'Use your normal file edit/str-replace tool to change beta to gamma in .debug/visual-smoke/cursor-mode.txt. Do not use shell.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label read-missing \
  --prompt 'Use only your file read tool to read .debug/visual-smoke/does-not-exist.txt. Then explain the result. Do not use shell, grep, glob, find, ls, edit, or write.'

npm run smoke:visual -- "${VISUAL_ARGS[@]}" \
  --label workflow-activity \
  --prompt 'Stay in Cursor plan mode. If Cursor exposes plan, todo, task, or mode activity for this request, use that capability to outline a tiny unit test without editing files. Otherwise answer with a concise numbered plan. Do not use shell or file mutation tools.'
```

By default, `npm run smoke:visual` writes `.ansi`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.png`, and `.jsonl.path` artifacts. Check browser availability before a paid run. If PNG rendering fails but ANSI/HTML evidence was retained, render that retained evidence with the canonical browser/xterm path and save a PNG; do not repeat the model call merely to produce a screenshot. To visually audit bridge behavior or ambient Cursor settings, opt in with `--bridge`, `--bridge --expose-builtin-tools`, or `--setting-sources <value>` and label that evidence separately; do not count those opt-in runs as default native replay matrix proof.

Expected proof for each category is defined in [Cursor Native Tool Visual Audit Workflow](./cursor-native-tool-visual-audit.md). Do not mark a category passed because the prompt was sent. A category passes only when the PNG shows the expected card and the JSONL shows the expected completed `toolCall` / `toolResult` pair with the expected `isError` state.

Pass criteria:

- PNG screenshots exist for every claimed card category, not only text/JSONL logs.
- JSONL paths exist for every claimed card category.
- Each selected changed category has matching PNG + JSONL proof; retained exact-input proof covers unchanged categories. Do not claim unobserved categories.
- Native-looking read/search/find/list/shell/write/edit cards use intended pi card styling.
- Shell success is not red/error-styled; stdout is readable.
- Edit/diff previews show red/green added/removed colors and readable paths.
- True failures are visible, bounded, and distinct from neutral activity.
- Footer/status is readable in Cursor `plan` mode and combines with fast when applicable.
- Neutral Cursor plan/todo/task/mode activity is claimed only if JSONL contains a completed Cursor workflow event; if Cursor only returns plan text, record workflow activity as not exercised instead of passed.
- Evidence paths for ANSI capture, rendered PNG screenshots, JSONL, and debug artifact directories are recorded in [Cursor native tool visual audit](./cursor-native-tool-visual-audit.md) or the release handoff.
- No secrets, raw debug artifacts, or scratch output are committed.

## 5. Cursor SDK plan-mode provider check

```bash
PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none \
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --cursor-mode plan --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/cursor-mode-plan" \
  --session-id cursor-sdk-1016-plan \
  --no-tools \
  -p 'Cursor mode smoke. Reply with one short implementation plan for printing hello.' \
  > "$SMOKE_DIR/cursor-mode-plan.stdout.txt" \
  2> "$SMOKE_DIR/cursor-mode-plan.stderr.txt"
```

Pass criteria:

- Exit code is `0`.
- stdout contains a short plan-like answer.
- stderr is empty or contains only expected non-secret diagnostics.
- No pi active-tool or pi plan-mode state is mutated merely because Cursor SDK mode is `plan`.

## 6. Bridge multi-tool success and failure

```bash
PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none \
PI_CURSOR_EXPOSE_BUILTIN_TOOLS=1 \
PI_CURSOR_PI_TOOL_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1 \
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/bridge" \
  -p 'Bridge smoke. Do exactly two tool calls before answering: first call pi__read on ./package.json; second call pi__read on ./definitely-missing-pi-cursor-sdk-smoke-file.txt. Then answer: OK_NAME=<package name>; MISSING_RESULT=<error or success>. Do not use shell.' \
  > "$SMOKE_DIR/bridge.stdout.txt" \
  2> "$SMOKE_DIR/bridge.stderr.txt"
```

Pass criteria:

- stdout includes `OK_NAME=pi-cursor-sdk`.
- Diagnostics include `run_created`, `tools_exposed`, two `request_queued`, two `request_resolved`, and `run_disposed`.
- The missing-file request has `isError: true`.
- Persisted JSONL contains real pi tool calls named `read`, matching `toolResult` messages, and final assistant output.
- Later assistant usage counts consumed tool-result input; no assistant usage has negative values.

## 7. Native replay cards without the pi bridge

```bash
PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none \
PI_CURSOR_PI_TOOL_BRIDGE=0 \
PI_CURSOR_NATIVE_TOOL_DISPLAY=1 \
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/native-replay" \
  -p 'Native replay smoke. Use your Cursor file-reading capability to read ./README.md, then answer README_SEEN=yes if it contains pi-cursor-sdk.' \
  > "$SMOKE_DIR/native-replay.stdout.txt" \
  2> "$SMOKE_DIR/native-replay.stderr.txt"
```

Pass criteria:

- stdout includes `README_SEEN=yes`.
- Persisted JSONL shows an assistant `toolUse` turn with a replayed `read` tool call, a pi `read` `toolResult`, and a final assistant turn.
- Native replay is display-only: it must not re-run Cursor-side mutations or create duplicate pi mutations.

## 8. Diagnostics safety contract

Bridge diagnostics are scrubbed operational logs, not anonymous telemetry.

Allowed fields:

- event name
- run-safe correlation IDs that are not endpoint path components
- bridge run IDs remain `cursor-pi-bridge-run-*`; provider-facing bridge/pi tool call IDs encode the same run UUID as 32 hex characters, use the `cursor-pi-bridge-<32 hex>-t<counter>` shape, and stay within the 64-character limit
- hashed Cursor MCP call correlation IDs of the form `cursor-mcp-call-<8 hex chars>`
- exposed pi/MCP tool name pairs
- pending/queued/cancelled counts
- success/error booleans
- rejection kind

Forbidden fields:

- Cursor API keys or auth headers
- bearer tokens, cookies, sessions, or raw credential material
- endpoint URLs, endpoint path components, endpoint tokens, or loopback URLs
- raw tool args
- raw tool results
- stdout/stderr payloads
- file contents
- Cursor settings/skills startup output
- local private session paths in tracked docs

Run a forbidden-material scan over smoke stderr/captures:

```bash
forbidden_files="$(find "$SMOKE_DIR" -type f \( -name '*stderr.txt' -o -name '*capture*.txt' \) -print0 |
  xargs -0 grep -IlE 'CURSOR_API_KEY|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]+|/cursor-pi-tool-bridge/[^ ]+/mcp|127\.0\.0\.1:[0-9]+/cursor-pi-tool-bridge|apiKey|cookie|session-cookie|secret-token' || true)"
if [[ -n "$forbidden_files" ]]; then
  printf 'Forbidden material matched in smoke files; inspect locally without pasting matched lines.\n' >&2
  while IFS= read -r file; do
    [[ -z "$file" ]] && continue
    if [[ "$file" == "$SMOKE_DIR/"* ]]; then
      printf '  %s\n' "${file#"$SMOKE_DIR/"}" >&2
    else
      printf '  %s\n' "$file" >&2
    fi
  done <<<"$forbidden_files"
  exit 1
fi
```

Pass criteria:

- The scan returns no matching files except deliberately planted test strings that are asserted not to appear in serialized diagnostics, and it does not print matched secret-bearing lines.
- If tool names themselves are considered sensitive for a release target, do not enable `PI_CURSOR_PI_TOOL_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` for shared logs. The diagnostics contract intentionally allows tool names.

## 9. Long-running bridge and abort/cancel

Select this check only when changed abort cleanup needs new real-service evidence; otherwise reuse valid retained proof. Keep process, bridge, and persisted-session cleanup assertions intact.

Use a harmless long-running command and interrupt it after the bridge request is queued:

```bash
PI_CURSOR_SETTING_SOURCES=none \
PI_CURSOR_EXPOSE_BUILTIN_TOOLS=1 \
PI_CURSOR_PI_TOOL_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1 \
pi --approve -e . --cursor-no-fast --model cursor/grok-4.6 \
  --session-dir "$SMOKE_DIR/abort" \
  -p 'Abort smoke. Call pi__bash with command: sleep 30 && echo SHOULD_NOT_PRINT. Do not answer until the tool completes.'
```

Pass criteria:

- Interrupting the run does not leave `sleep 30`, `SHOULD_NOT_PRINT`, `pi`, or bridge-related child processes running.
- Diagnostics either show clean cancellation/disposal or the process exits cleanly without orphaning children.
- Persisted JSONL does not contain a false successful final answer.

## 10. Final structural session scan

After all live runs, scan JSONL structurally instead of reading raw content into a report:

```bash
node scripts/validate-smoke-jsonl.mjs "$SMOKE_DIR"
```

Script-enforced pass criteria:

- Every scanned JSONL file is parseable and non-empty.
- Every scanned JSONL file contains at least one assistant message.
- Every assistant message has usage metadata.
- Assistant usage `input`, `output`, and `totalTokens` are non-negative numbers.
- Assistant usage components are non-negative and add coherently to `totalTokens`. Safe local raw turn usage maps its full-prompt input and cache partitions directly; unsafe local data and Cloud turns use bounded estimates. SDK billed snapshots remain in the durable usage ledger and never replace assistant-message context usage.

Additional manual usage checks for provider/accounting changes:

- Each assistant message's disjoint input/cache/output components should sum to `totalTokens` and describe one coherent current context, not cumulative billed spend.
- In split runs, earlier tool results can remain in later current-context estimates. Fresh, attributable LOCAL SDK usage takes precedence; late raw and billed facts remain in the separate ledger without rewriting emitted messages. See [context, compaction, and Cursor usage](../README.md#context-compaction-and-cursor-usage).

## 11. Standard local gates

```bash
git diff --check
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm pack --dry-run
```

Pass criteria:

- All commands exit `0`.
- `npm pack --dry-run` includes all new runtime source files and the compiled `dist/` output, and excludes local smoke artifacts, sessions, package tarballs, `.env*`, `.pi/`, and `coverage/`.

## 12. Cleanup

```bash
tmux list-sessions | grep 'pi-cursor-sdk-smoke' || true
rm -rf "$SMOKE_DIR"
```

Pass criteria:

- No smoke tmux sessions remain.
- No smoke child processes remain.
- No smoke artifacts are committed.

## Coverage gaps this checklist makes explicit

Use this list to choose meaningful changed-behavior coverage, not to trigger a full paid replay. Prefer offline contracts and valid retained evidence:

- Long-running bridged tool abort/cancel cleanup.
- Native replay cards beyond read, especially shell/edit/write cards, when those renderers change.
- Bridge question UI when `cursor_ask_question` changes.
- MCP timeout override behavior (3600s `callTool` default, 10s initialize/listTools default, and SDK-default unknown protocol stacks) when timeout code changes.
- SDK `semSearch` / `recordScreen` activity replay when those formatters change. There is no reliable local prompt that forces Cursor to call these built-in SDK tools on demand; regression is covered by `test/cursor-tool-transcript.test.ts`. Opportunistically confirm neutral `Cursor semantic search` / `Cursor screen recording` cards if a live run surfaces them.
- Ambient Cursor setting-source behavior when startup filtering or local Cursor settings handling changes.
- Model discovery aliases/context variants when model-discovery code or Cursor SDK versions change.

If changed behavior needs real-service proof and neither retained evidence nor an existing focused check covers it, report the specific gap and choose the smallest meaningful check. Do not assume mocks prove service behavior or make unrelated optional lanes a release requirement.
